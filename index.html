                Susan Harting, 66, who lives on 35th Ave, Oakland, believes there should be equal distribution of trees in Oakland, CA.

              Volunteers assemble on a wet field under a bright, sunny sky, shovels in hand. There is a mixture of anticipation and the aroma of damp grass. Forming a line, they exchange smiles and small talk while their rubber boots squelch in the mud. They wait with anticipation for instructions. Some take pictures, documenting the start of their impact on the planet. They are brought together by a shared sense of purpose, which brings together people from many walks of life. They started digging holes for seedlings as soon as the organizer gave them the go-ahead. Their bond with the earth and one another becomes stronger with each shovel stroke.

                “It's good to have trees in disadvantaged areas and that's why I've been volunteering for Trees for Oakland for more than a year,” said Harding.

                A recent event called the 100 Trees for Earth Day with Transformative Climate Communities was held in Arrowhead Marsh, East Oakland, on Saturday, April 20, 2024. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The Planting Partners included Trees for Oakland, Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation, Biological Reserve Cerro Hermoso, East Bay Regional Parks District, Clean CA - Caltrans, HandsOn Bay Area, California Volunteers, California Climate Action Corps, City of Oakland, Better Neighborhoods Same Neighbors, A Plus Tree LLC, Bay Area Rapid Transit, along with many other Bay Area residents, businesses, and community organizations. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Several people showed up to the event eager to help reduce tree inequity in East Oakland, with Harting being one of them. "It's important because, in other places, such as Berkeley or some wealthy parts of Oakland, there are more trees. This makes a significant impact because the shade reduces heat, and the more heat, the more health issues develop,” said Harting. 
            </p>

            <h2 id="tree-cover-equity">The Need for Tree Cover Equity</h2>

            <p>
                The city of Oakland was named after the abundance of oak trees that originally stood there. Today, more than 200,000 trees grace the streets, medians, and parks of Oakland. The distribution of tree cover is unequal; nevertheless, as is typical in many urban areas, affluent neighborhoods typically have more trees than less wealthy ones and places with a higher residential density.
            </p>

            <p>
                In an effort to address the disparity, the city and local groups are implementing tree-planting initiatives all across Oakland. Between 2019 and 2023, the city planted 700 trees in low-income neighborhoods, mostly in parks from West to East Oakland.

            <p>
                Bart Wright, an Oakland-based map and spatial data designer for Trees for Oakland, said, “It isn't as if we could plant trees wherever on the side of the road. It seems as though that land that was chosen belongs to someone, or that's where the sewer pipes are hidden, or the power lines are above. So, we chose a park with the city’s permission where there would be limited restrictions.
            </p>

            <h2 id="city-initiatives">The Initiatives of The City of Oakland</h2>

            <p>
                The city of Oakland has recognized the dire need for trees in East Oakland. Federal cash totaling $8 million has been granted to the City of Oakland for tree-planting initiatives in 2023. Thanks to this funding, which is part of a bigger effort by the US Department of Agriculture, more trees will be planted in urban areas across the country.

            <p>
                The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool was used by both the grantees and the Urban and Community Forestry Program to determine which communities would reap the greatest benefits. Funds are scheduled to be distributed in the near future. The grant's unique feature is that it doesn't require a local government or organization to match funds. This makes it more accessible to cities, counties, and non-profits that are struggling with budget constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
                Experts in urban design have praised this objective, stating that neighborhoods with few trees have serious negative effects on human health and the environment.

            <h2 id="community-projects">The Need for Community-Based Tree Planting Projects</h2>              

            <p>
                Urban tree-planting initiatives have been a priority for the Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation in a number of city communities, including important parts of East Oakland. Mandolin Kadera-Redmond, Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation Executive Director said that the urban heat island effect—increased temperatures caused by an excess of concrete and buildings—and poor air quality make these places extremely in need of greening.

              Volunteers and organizers converge, united by purpose after they select a space some distance away to plant saplings. Shovels dig into mud, creating pockets for saplings. "Angle the shovel slightly," the organizer demonstrates, "and push with your legs, not your back. We want deep, sturdy holes." Volunteers nod, mirroring the technique. Dirt flies as they work in synchronized rhythm, a ballet of earth and effort. Each plant finds its new home, nestled in freshly turned soil.

                Kadera-Redmond said that the communities that are suffering from food deserts and extreme heat are the same ones that were disregarded and did not receive the same facilities. "The heat, poor air quality, and lack of fresh produce are to blame for their plight." 
            </p>

            <p>
                Ending on a positive note, an email comes from Alex Pinto, the Community Greening Program Manager for Oakland Parks and Recreation Foundation and the main organizer of 100 Trees for Earth Day with Transformative Climate Communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                The email reads, “Thank you all for coming out for Oakland, your family, your friends, and our environment! Together, we planted 90 trees in two and a half hours! We set a new record for the number of volunteers at a tree planting event and the number of trees planted in one day!”
